# git-commands
Exploring git commands with terminal and git client (Fork)

Why are we doing this? 
— To master command line, everything we do by GUI can also be done by your terminal or CLI

What are we learning ?
- Lesson 1: Using Shell in your computer 

To use Operating System services we use a shell. It can be either a GUI or CLI.  
Example: Type in `Date` in your terminal, you will see the current date. 
Type in echo hello world, you’ll see hello world printed in your terminal. `Echo` is basically used to print just like in PHP

*How does the shell know where is your program located?*
It uses Environment Variables.  Yes
